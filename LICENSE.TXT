MTCONNECT SPECIFICATION 
IMPLEMENTER LICENSE AGREEMENT 

MTConnect, a forum sponsored by AMT Ð The Association For Manufacturing
Technology ("AMT"), is a collaborative effort to develop open technical
standards and specifications intended to foster greater interoperability
between equipment automation/control applications, and field systems/devices in
the manufacturing industry, as well as schema, prototype software examples, and
related documentation (as defined below, the "MTConnect Specification" and
"MTConnect Materials"), and to promote and facilitate implementation of the
MTConnect Specification in compliant applications, drivers, and other services.
This MTConnect Specification Implementer License Agreement ("Agreement") sets
forth the license terms and other terms of use for you, as an MTConnect
Implementer, to make use of the MTConnect Materials for purposes of adopting or
implementing the MTConnect Specification in compliant products, whether
hardware or software. By checking the box indicating that you accept the terms
of this Agreement, and clicking "I agree" below or otherwise using any of the
MTConnect Materials for purposes of implementation in compliant products, you
(for yourself and for any other person or entity that employs you, that you
represent or on whose behalf you act) hereby enter into this Agreement and, in
consideration of the license and agreements contained herein, and other good
and valuable consideration the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, agree
as follows.

1.	DEFINITIONS

You 
"The term "you" and "your" as used in this Agreement includes you and any
other person or entity you that employs you, that you represent or on whose
behalf you are acting that will use the MTConnect Materials and/or implement
the MTConnect Specification.

Affiliate
means any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by, under 
common control with, or that controls another entity.  For this purpose, 
"control" means direct or indirect ownership of, or the right to exercise, 
greater than 50% of the voting power, or greater than 50% of the 
ownership interest representing the right to make the decisions for the 
entity.

MTConnect
Specification or Specification means a final technical specification document,
as adopted and approved by the Technical Steering Committee, following approval
by majority vote of the Technical Advisory Group, for publication as an
MTConnect Specification, that defines specifications, schemas, standard
interfaces, objects, and methods for exchange of dynamic sensor data,
configuration data, and data representation among machines, software
applications and controllers. Specifications shall include or incorporate
software code only as reference implementations, optional examples, or other
code that will be used for illustrative purposes only and will not be a
required portion of the Specification.

MTConnect Materials
means MTConnect Specifications, schema, optional software examples 
or reference implementations, related documentation or guides, and any 
materials, updates or modifications related to any of the foregoing.

MTConnect Implementeror Implementor
means any party that has entered into or later enters into a MTConnect 
Implementer License Agreement.

Necessary Claims
means those claims of all patents and patent applications that an entity 
owns or controls that would necessarily be infringed by implementation 
of an MTConnect Specification.  A claim is "necessarily infringed" when 
there is no reasonable non-infringing alternative for implementing the 
required portions of the Specification.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Necessary Claims do not include the following:
(a)	claims other than those set forth above even if contained in 
the same patent or patent application as Necessary Claims;
(b)	claims that are necessarily infringed only by portions of a 
product or implementation that are not required for 
compliance with the Specification;
(c)	claims covering any enabling technologies that may be 
necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that 
complies with a Specification, but are not themselves 
expressly set forth in a Specification;
(d)	claims covering reference implementations or other 
implementation examples (i.e., examples that may be 
included in the text of a Specification and which illustrate how 
the Specification could be properly implemented); or
(e)	claims covering the implementation of other published 
specifications not developed by or for MTConnect or AMT, 
but referred to in the body of a Specification. 

Excluded Claims
means Necessary Claims that a Participant has timely disclosed, with all 
required information, and declared to be excluded from Participant's 
obligations to license on royalty-free terms; provided that Excluded 
Claims are subject to obligations to license on reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms.

[It is the general policy and intention of MTConnect to minimize 
Excluded Claims by drafting MTConnect Specifications to avoid 
infringing such Claim(s) once a Participant has given notice it intends to 
designate a claim as an Excluded Claim.  The MTConnect website 
provides information concerning such Excluded Claims, if any have in 
fact been designated.]  [Confirm whether to include either one or both of 
these sentences statement]  

Participant
means an entity, company, organization or individual who participates in 
the work of the MTConnect Technical Advisory Group, Technical 
Steering Committee, Drafting Committee, or any other committee or 
group created by the Technical Steering Committee to assist in technical 
work to develop MTConnect Materials.
Implementer
means an entity, company, organization or individual who makes use of 
the MTConnect Materials for purposes of adopting or implementing the 
MTConnect Specification in compliant products, whether hardware or 
software.

I need to better understand this.  This seems to address products and are these products that may be necessary to 
implement the standard?
